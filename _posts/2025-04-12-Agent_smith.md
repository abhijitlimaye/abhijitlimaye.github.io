**Agent Smith**  
_The Matrix Got it right._

“Agent Smith” is the real AI Agent. Let me explain why I say this.

There are more than coincidental similarities between what Agent Smith was and how the new-age “Agentic AI” systems are being developed. To that end, the movie *The Matrix* really seems prophetic in predicting the development of AI Agentic systems.

Let’s see how:

---

### 🔗 Connected

Agent Smith was always connected to the Matrix.  
He knew what was going on—had situational awareness, context, and the latest information on the resistance's activities.

---

### 🛠️ Tool Use

Agent Smith could make use of all available tools in the environment.  
He could use weapons, communications, and morph into any other human entities in the Matrix.

---

### 💪 Powerful

Agent Smith was very powerful.  
No one else—other than Neo—could fight Agent Smith and survive!

---

### 🧬 Clone / Build New Agents

While we haven’t yet reached a stage where Agentic AI systems can clone or build new agents autonomously, the day is not far.  
Agent Smith had the superpower to clone himself and create new agents.

---

### 🤖 Autonomous / Independent / Decision-Making

Agent Smith exemplifies autonomy:

- Tasked with capturing or killing Neo, he devised various schemes independently.
- He had the ability to plan and take decisions—even when disconnected from the Matrix.
- Recall the scene where he tries to break down Morpheus using his own techniques.
- Or the train platform fight—Smith is acting on his own initiative, not under direct control.

---

### 🎯 Orchestration

Agent Smith didn’t work alone.  
He collaborated with other agents—guiding them, commanding them, and orchestrating workflows to reach his goal.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Agent Smith isn’t just a fictional villain—he’s an early metaphor for what we now understand as *Agentic AI*. The parallels are uncanny, and perhaps, intentional. 
*The Matrix Got it Right!*
