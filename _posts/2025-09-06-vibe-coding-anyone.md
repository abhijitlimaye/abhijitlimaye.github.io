*If you can’t code yourself, you won’t get too far with vibe coding!*

Let me start the blog from the “lessons learned” and some “pro tips” before diving into my experience of vibe-coding. If you are short on time (or attention span), just the points below are a good starting point.

## The Biggest Challenge

The biggest challenge of vibe coding is to get the AI to come out of what I call the:

**“Self-Destruct Loop of Regressions” (SDLR)**  
*(should I trademark this term? 🙂)*

My take is this: you need some experience of coding to really get around these challenges.

## Pro Tips for Vibe Coding

1. Start by clearly defining and explaining the role to AI.  
   For example: “You are a senior developer building apps to solve customer problems.”

2. Give clear instructions on how you want the code to be.  
   “You will suggest code that is well designed, extensible, modular, and maintainable.”

3. Explain the feature you want to implement to AI, and ask it to repeat its understanding.

4. For UI features, you can ask AI to generate a text-based wireframe. Try it, it’s good!

5. 🚫 Make sure that it doesn’t dump a ton of code on you.  
   In my case, after I “learned” how to work with AI to get the best outcome, my instructions were always:  
   “Do not generate code first. First give me your design thinking on how you will structure the code.”

6. Ask for surgical fixes with precise code and step-by-step instructions instead of large dumps.

7. ⚠️ Watch out for regressions.  AI can “regress” on its own design or code choices. It will suggest code that is confusing and contradictory to some of the earlier code it generated. Point that out clearly. Make it very clear that it’s gone in a regression loop and ask it to drop its current line of thinking. Make it “think differently” (whatever that means for a LLM, that is! 😁 )

8. 🐞 Whenever you hit compile or runtime errors, feed AI the debug output or error messages. It usually suggests quick fixes.

9. Try to understand the logic behind the code. Don’t trust AI blindly — I often had to refactor the code a few times as what it gave was poorly structured or not good!

10. Pick up one feature addition at a time after a working baseline / MVP.  
    Keep a separate working copy — better yet, use Git with feature branches.

11. As chats grow, AI may “forget” context. The chat becomes unwieldy and unmanageable.  
    Ask it to load its memory, get the “context” back and summarize what you have been doing. Go ahead only after you find the summary to be good.

12. ❌ Keep an eye on the “Self-destruct loop of regressions” (SDLR) when new code generated by AI breaks something done earlier and when you point that out, it gives a code to fix the problem but breaks something else.

13. 🔄 If you hit this SDLR, I actually switched to another AI (gemini from chatGPT) but had to provide it with much more context of what I was doing. I eventually got it working though, but here’s where the ‘experienced coder’ part comes in.

## My Experience: Building a Task App in Flutter

I decided to build a simple task-keeping app using Flutter, without knowing a thing about how to build flutter apps.
Well, what better challenge than to use “vibe coding,” that’s all en vogue these days!

### Setup

- Installed VS Code, Android SDK, Java SDK, Flutter SDK, Android Debug Bridge, and Android Emulator.  
- Took ~2.5–3 hours without Android Studio (which would’ve been easier).  
- AI pointed me to some reference videos. Instructions were okay, with a few hiccups.  

With the Flutter extension in VS Code, creating a new app gives you boilerplate code and a working home screen.

### First Steps

I described my feature set to ChatGPT.  
It gave clear instructions on files, folder hierarchy, and key configs.   
Of interest for someone who is not initiated into the flutter app dev, (`pubspec.yaml`, `AndroidManifest.xml`). play an important role.
So far so good, the app was built and I could test it out on the local emulator I installed during the setup phase. 


Some feature additions went smoothly:

- Switching between card view and list view  
- Replacing default table layout with a styled version (header row, color bands)

### Hitting the SDLR

As the code grew, chat interactions grew with it. Eventually, ChatGPT responses slowed and regressed.  
It’s essentially around this time that chatGPT hit SDLR

When I could not get around this problem, .. frustrated.. I simply stopped for a day. 
When I thought over it and realized that all this while, I was working in a ‘slave mode’ where I was just trying to follow what AI (master) was telling me.

I changed my approach.  
I became the **master**, trusted my developer instinct, and switched to Gemini.  
I gave it full context (file names, class names, features).  
Then I picked the cleanest code between ChatGPT and Gemini and **rebuilt my app manually**.  

Painful? Yes.  
But it got me to a good working state.

## Most Frustrating Parts

## Most Frustrating Parts

- 🐞 Fixing the compile and run-time errors was painful.  
- A Contacts-picker crash tested my patience the most. Finally, as per Gemini’s suggestion, I connected my phone using USB to my laptop, turned USB debug on, ran a debug build on the phone, and captured crash logs using the ADB tool. After a couple of attempts, Gemini correctly pointed out the issue, and that finally fixed the crash!

- ❓  I still don’t fully understand how Flutter code works, but I find the parts around **Scaffold** and **Build**, required for UI rendering, to be tedious and very fragile for code changes. Especially the Java/Flutter syntax — all those brackets (round, curly, square) are an eyesore for someone used to C/C++.

- Same goes for commas and semicolons. I still can’t tell where and how these are used in Flutter code 🙁  
-  As for the code structure — the less I talk, the better. It completely hits my sense of *code aesthetics*, if you know what I mean!

## The End Result

A fully functional task app with these features:

- Add new tasks  
- Home screen toggle: Card view ↔ List view  
- Filters: hide completed / show today’s tasks  
- Contacts picker to assign tasks to people  
- Share a task via Android’s standard share popup  
- App lock for added security
